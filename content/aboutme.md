## Experience

### Data Engineer (2013.06 - 2018.06)

I have built data platforms based on Spark ecosystem for 3 companies.

### Freelancer (2018.06 - Present)

I was offered a remote part-time job opportunity overseas. It's a small team with less than 10 people and most of us are from China and US. Unlike my previous jobs, this time I was developing a distributed SQL engine in C/C++.

In the meantime, I make the most of my spare time doing what I love. For example, reading books, fitness and gaming.

After around 1 year of freelancing, I felt like to try to build a product. The first product I built was a smarthome for local network. The second product was a fitness platform which allowed users to pick the best independent trainers for them. Though neither of these products ended up being so successful as expected, my product sense is being shaped.
