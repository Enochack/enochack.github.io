# Career

## Data Engineer (2013.06 - 2018.06)

My career was started from a startup in Nanjing, whose product is a user data analytics platform. And I was a data engineer who built the data platform with Hadoop, Spark, and HBase.

Then I joined a larger startup in Beijing and still worked on a user data analytics platform as a data engineer. So I got quite familiar with the Spark/Hadoop ecosystem during these years.

Finally I entered the workforce of a large multinational company in Shanghai. However, I didn't like the way of working there. So I quit very soon.

## Free Lancer (2018.06 - Present)

I was offered a remote part-time job opportunity overseas. It's a small team with less than 10 people and most of us are from China and US. Unlike my previous jobs, this time I was developing a distributed SQL engine in C/C++. However, it is still for building data platforms.

In the meantime, I make the most of my spare time doing what I love. For example, reading books, fitness and gaming.

After 10+ months, somehow, I felt like to build my own products. The first product I built was a local smarthome system, which is able to work without internet. The second product was a fitness platform which allowed users to pick the best independent trainers for them. Though neither of these products ended up being successful, I got invaluable experience.

I'm always on the way of exploring and hacking.
