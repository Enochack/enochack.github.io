[Computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) is the study of [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation): that is, how to represent and process information. Here are just a few of the concepts you might study:

1.  **Problem solving**: youâ€™ll learn [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) - that is, general strategies, such as [divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm),[recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_algorithm),[heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_algorithm), [greedy search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm), and [randomized algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm) - that help you model, decompose, and solve *any* kind of problem.
2.  **Logic**: you will start to use precise and formal methods of thinking, including [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)),[boolean logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_logic), [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), and [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), so you can solve problems in an air tight manner.
3.  **Data**: you will touch [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) and start asking questions like what *is* information? How do you represent it? How do you model the real world?
4.  **Systems**: how do you design and build complex systems that satisfy a set of requirements and constraints? [Systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) is an essential topic in almost every business.
5.  **Thinking**: one of the best ways to understand the human mind is to try to replicate it. Topics like [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence),
[machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning),[computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), and [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) are at the forefront of not only computer science, but also biology, psychology, philosophy, and mathematics.
